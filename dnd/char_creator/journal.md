The purpose of this project is mostly just to practice working with creating classes in python. Creating a DnD character will allow me to see get practice with the mechanics of creating class-based objects.

Watched a class tutorial that was more helpful than others:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s
Also followed a pre-made code for making flash cards: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-build-flashcard-using-class-in-python/

Using both of those, I toyed with classes and made a working program that creates characters with a name and a race. The program prints out each character's name and race after the user is done adding them to a list.
