# Dungeons and Dragons Character Title Creator
## Print out a character's name, race, and class with this class-based python program.
### Started 5/9/2021

### 5/9
The purpose of this project is mostly just to practice working with creating classes in python. Creating a DnD character will allow me to see get practice with the mechanics of creating class-based objects.

Watched a class tutorial that was more helpful than others:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s
Also followed a pre-made code for making flash cards: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-build-flashcard-using-class-in-python/

Using both of those, I toyed with classes and made a working program that creates characters with a name and a race. The program prints out each character's name and race after the user is done adding them to a list.

Back at it with the Python after a long summer.
I want to finish up my DnD project to solidify the basics of Classes.

To review, classes essentially create a blueprint for new objects. the init method grabs a variable and makes an instance out of by assigning it defined attributes.

The program I want to make will do the following:
1-Ask the user for their character's name
2-Roll a simulated die to determine that character's attribute values
3-Put that character and its name and data into a list
4-When the user has no more names to add, display the full list of characters and their attributes after all chars have been created.

I was able to complete all four goals! The file is cards.py.
