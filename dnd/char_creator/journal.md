# Dungeons and Dragons Character Title Creator
## Print out a character's name, race, and class with this class-based python program.
### Started 5/9/2021

### 5/9
The purpose of this project is mostly just to practice working with creating classes in python. Creating a DnD character will allow me to see get practice with the mechanics of creating class-based objects.

Watched a class tutorial that was more helpful than others:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s
Also followed a pre-made code for making flash cards: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-build-flashcard-using-class-in-python/

Using both of those, I toyed with classes and made a working program that creates characters with a name and a race. The program prints out each character's name and race after the user is done adding them to a list.

Back at it with the Python after a long summer.
I want to finish up my DnD project to solidify the basics of Classes.
Then I want to start taking the Coursera course on Climate Change Data Analysis, which is meant as an intro level coding and data sci course. Ultimately I want to start building a data science portfolio. Doing this alongside my over-full-time schedule of earning a teaching MA and working at the school AND catching up on my Earth Science will be difficult, but I think that by making my Python projects focused on earth science, I can create some synergy that ultimately saves time by making studying more enjoyable.
